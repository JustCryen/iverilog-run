# iverilog-run
 Script automating iverilog and gtkwave simulation creation and execution

## Syntax

```
OPTIONS:
    -q - omits gtkwave simulation for both, current execution and the save file

> iverilog-run.sh <options>
```

On first run in a directory, `iverilog-run` will ask for output file name (for .vvp generation and also finding a matching .lxt dumpfile name)  
Next, it'll ask for the verilog files you want to include.  
After successful execution, you'll be asked if you want to create / overwrite the savefile.  

All the files (.vvp and save file) will be generated in the output directory created in a location of execution.  
In case of the .lxt file, provided by the testbench, it will need to be generated by the testbench in the output directory.  

Example testbench lxt generation:
```
initial begin
	$dumpfile ("output/<file>.lxt"); //relative path from the iverilog-run execution location
	$dumpvars (0, core_tb);
	$dumpon;
end
```
(this replaces the .vcd dumpfile)
